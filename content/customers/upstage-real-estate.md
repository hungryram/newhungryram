### Overview

Rob Spencer is the broker of Upstage Real Estate in Arkansas. He was in search for a website developer to manage and support his website.

### The Design

Rob decided to use the standard template that was built for the real estate industry. It allows Rob to manually add in listings, agents, and his partners. The design was straight forward by choosing a primary and secondary color.

### The Result

After launching the site, I always run a speed test to ensure that the site is loading fast enough. Of course, when we build a site using the JAMstack architecture, we were able to score the website over 90 on desktop.
