### Overview

Andrea Ellery and Darrylle Ferrara is a team of 2. They moved their site away from Placester due to high fees and complicated back end. Andrea trusted me to manage and update their website with an easy to use back end and manage their listings.

### The Design

The website is using the standard website template built for real estate. With a little modification, I was able to get the design that Andrea and Darrylle was looking for.

### The Result

After launching the website, we integrated IDX which allows listings to automatically pull in. The site ranks over 90 on Google Pagespeed and is being indexed in the Google console.
