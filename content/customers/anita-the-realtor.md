Anita E. Iswanto is a southern California Real Estate Specialist since 2009. Anita contacted the team to redesign the website due to her web manager retiring.

### Overview

At the time, Wordpress was the trending technology and still is.. but now with new technology stacks like JAMstack, we decided it's time to move her site to a better performing platform.

The site was integrated with the California Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS) to allow visitors to search for homes in the area. Wordpress plugins were installed to achieve the result through iHomefinder, an IDX provider for MLS boards and data transferring to any third party websites.

### Using a Child Theme

The Genesis framework was the most popular at the time because it provided the fastest and most lightweight theme for websites. We were able to restructure one of the child themes of Genesis and make it cater to the real estate industry.

The site was easily set up by just installing the theme, plugin, and filling in the information, design, and integrated IDX. This allowed to keep the cost of development low and affordable for Anita to launch the website in 3 days.
