Sandra Cervantes is a visionary with the business acumen to take a deal from conception to fruition.  Ms. Cervantes is a highly successful real estate business owner and investor with an uncanny ability to bring together the right people in the right places at the right time.  She believes when convenience and opportunity coincide – the synergy is infinite.  The National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP) has recognized Cervantes as one of the top 250 real estate professional in the nation.  She has worked in the field of housing and community development throughout her career and is an advocate on home ownership education and sustainability issues.  The Sandra Cervantes team is made up of highly -skilled individuals in the real estate industry.

### Overview

Sandra Cervantes was a broker working with Realty One Group in Orange County, CA. She was going through different website providers who would overcharge for overly complicated websites that provided no results. We decided Wordpress would be a good alternative.

### The Regret

Wordpress. Who knew Wordpress would cause so many headaches for the team and the client? Luckily visitors were not impacted but server maintenance and and database injections would occur. Who wouldn't have guessed it? But with Wordpress being the largest competitors out there, it's bound to get malware on any site.

### The Move

While we are in the process of moving the site over to the JAMstack architecture, we provided the benefits to Sandra and how it can improve her score and site. While this is a major move, it will be worth it in the long run.
